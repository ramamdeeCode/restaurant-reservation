## DESCRIPTION

A restaurant manager wants to create a new reservation when a customer calls so that she knows how many customers will show up on a given day. _Periodic Tables_ allows her to create a new reservation with the guest's name, number, party size, date, and time.

The restaurant manager only wants reservations to be made during business hours so that she or one of her employees doesn't accidentally make a reservation for a date or time that they cannot accommodate their guests. _Periodic Tables_ limits the creation of new reservations to future dates and during business hours (currently, between 10:30 am and 9:30 pm every day except Tuesdays).

The restaurant manager wants to be able to assign guests with a reservation to a table when they arrive. This way she can keep track of who is seated and which tables are occupied. _Periodic Tables_ allows her to create tables with a name and capacity. She can then use the app to assign a reservation to an available table (one with a capacity that will accommodate the reservation's guests). She can then free up the table when the guests are done.

The restaurant manager wants to be able to easily see the status of the reservations so she can keep track of which guests have been served. _Periodic Tables_ assigns a status of _booked, seated, finished,_ or _canceled_. _finished_ and _canceled_ reservations are hidden from the dashboard.

The restaurant manager wants to be able to search for a reservation by phone number so that if they call with a question, she can quickly find their reservation. _Periodic Tables_ allows her to search a partial or complete phone number and get back a list of all matching reservations.

The restaurant manager wants to be able to modify or cancel a reservation to keep the reservations up to date. _Periodic Tables_ allows reservations that have not yet been seated to be edited or canceled.

## API

### Reservations

The `reservations` table represents reservations to the restaurant. Each reservation has the following fields:

- `reservation_id`: (Primary Key)
- `first_name`: (String) The first name of the customer.
- `last_name`: (String) The last name of the customer.
- `mobile_number`: (String) The customer's cell number.
- `reservation_date`: (Date) The date of the reservation.
- `reservation_time`: (Time) The time of the reservation.
- `people`: (Integer) The size of the party.
- `Status`: (String) The reservation status can be _booked, seated, finished, or cancelled_ and defaults to _booked._

An example record looks like the following:

```json
{
  "first_name": "Rick",
  "last_name": "Sanchez",
  "mobile_number": "202-555-0164",
  "reservation_date": "2020-12-31",
  "reservation_time": "20:00:00",
  "people": 6,
  "status": "booked"
}
```

### Tables

The `tables` table represents the tables that are available in the restaurant. Each table has the following fields:

- `table_id`: (Primary Key)
- `table_name`: (String) The name of the table.
- `capacity`: (Integer) The maximum number of people that the table can seat.
- `reservation_id`: (Foreign Key) The reservation - if any - that is currently seated at the table.

An example record looks like the following:

```json
{
  "table_name": "Bar #1",
  "capacity": 1,
  "reservation_id": 8
}
```
